# Cat_dog_Detection
This is a basic model which we can find out accuracy vs loss tradeoff using different types hypeparameter.Depending on size of datasets your model can have high bias or low bias.You can downlaod dataset from the following link:https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/confirmation.aspx?id=54765
It provide an accuracy of 75% with a loss of around 10 to 12%.
You can analyze your model tradeoffs using the following command in your ide command prompt:
tensorboard --logdir=logs/
